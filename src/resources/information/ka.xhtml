    <h2>შესავალი</h2>

    <p>
      თორიუმ რიდერი არის ვინდოუს 10, მაკისა და ლინუქსის წამკითხველ აპლიკაციათა რჩეული.
    </p>
    <p>
      This <a href="https://edrlab.org">EDRLab</a> application is in constant
      development and aims at becoming a reference for accessing EPUB
      publications, PDF documents, audiobooks and visual narratives, optionally
      protected by the <a href="https://edrlab.org/readium-lcp">LCP DRM</a> (DRM
      meaning Digital Rights Management).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is localized in a large set of languages; each version is offering new
      languages, thanks to the help of our community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Huge efforts are also made to get Thorium Reader highly accessible for
      visually impaired and dyslexic people.
    </p>
    <p>This application is free, with no ads and no leaks of private data.</p>
    <p>
      This is the perfect tools for heavy readers, library patrons and students.
    </p>

    <h2>Supported publication formats</h2>

    <p>
      <b>EPUB 2</b>: this is a legacy format, only adequate for basic ebooks.
      Textual content is formatted in XHTML 1 and no multimedia feature is
      supported. EPUB 2 ebooks are still accessible if properly formatted.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>EPUB 3</b>: this is the recommended format for the 21st century.
      Textual content is formatted in (X)HTML 5, it is possible to create
      fixed-layout ebooks, enriched ebooks and accessibiltiy features are well
      designed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>PDF</b>: despite a well-known lack of flexibility (no reflow option)
      and accessibility, many ebooks are still available in PDF only, especially
      in public libraries.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Audiobooks</b>: a
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/audiobooks/"
        >standardized format for audiobooks</a
      >
      has been designed by the W3C Publishing Working Group in 2020, and EDRLab
      was part of this WG. Thorium is supporting the
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/lpf/">packaged (LPF)</a> audiobook format,
      which will soon be widely used by booksellers, or so we hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Visual narratives</b>: EDRLab has designed a standard format for
      comics, manga, webtoons and other styles of digital works based on
      sequances of images.
      <a href="https://www.edrlab.org/open-standards/">Divina</a> is the name of
      this format. This is still an experimental format, and we hope that
      publishers will size it in 2021+.
    </p>

    <h2>Accessibility</h2>

    <p>
      Thorium Reader is for everyone, including people who are blind or have
      other print disabilities. The application is compatible with screen
      readers including JAWS, NVDA, Narrator and VoiceOver, and it includes a
      read aloud feature with visual highlighting. Thorium Reader can be used
      with the mouse or keyboard, and keyboard shortcuts are configurable. The
      display can be personalized to suit user’s needs, including colors, text
      size, spacing, font and layout.
    </p>

    <p>
      EDRLab has strong relationships with the
      <a href="https://daisy.org/">DAISY Consortium</a>. Together with people
      with print disabilities who participate in our design and testing, we are
      making Thorium Reader one of the most accessible reading applications
      available.
    </p>

    <h2>OPDS Catalogs</h2>

    <p>
      Many Public Libraries and booksellers are adopting
      <a href="https://opds.io/">OPDS</a> as a standard way to expose their
      catalogs on the Web.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using OPDS, libraries and booksellers can also expose the personal
      bookshelf of a patron or customer, i.e. the ebooks the user has acquired
      and can immediately download and read.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thorium can browse OPDS 1 and 2 catalogs. It also supports several OPDS
      compliant authentication mechanisms, and can therefore allow users access
      to their personal bookshelf.
    </p>

    <h2>Readium LCP DRM</h2>

    <img src="./images/lcp-user.png" alt="LCP user reading" />

    <p>
      Thorium Reader supports the
      <a href="https://www.edrlab.org/readium-lcp/">Readium LCP DRM</a>,
      originally designed by the Readium Foundation. The
      <a href="https://readium.org/lcp-specs/"
        >specification of this DRM is public</a
      >, and this is an ISO Technical Specification under the reference
      <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/79485.html">ISO 23078-2</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      LCP has already been adopted by many Public Libraries, Universities and
      booksellers around the world (<a
        href="https://www.edrlab.org/readium-lcp/certified-apps-servers/"
        >a list is maintained here</a
      >).
    </p>
    <p>
      Organizations in the publishing sector, worldwide, are encouraged to adopt
      LCP as a way to protect ebooks against oversharing, while offering to
      users a frictionless experience and keeping content properly accessible.
      Please <a href="https://www.edrlab.org/contact/">contact EDRLab</a> if
      your organization is interested by adopting LCP.
