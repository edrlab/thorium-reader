Integrating this technology in Thorium Reader allows you to download an ebook or audiobook directly into Thorium Reader for instant reading.\nHow do you connect your French public library account to Thorium Reader? It's simple. Enter a French city ('Paris') or part of the library name in the Search field and hit the Search button. A list of public libraries corresponding to your search will appear. Select a library and hit Add. In the updated list of catalogs, select this library: an authentication form is displayed. Enter your username/email address and password, and hit Login. You can now see the content of your personal bookshelf, from which you can download and read the ebooks and audiobooks you previously borrowed.",

With OPDS, you can navigate through catalogs from various ebook providers, sign up, borrow, buy a publication, or visit your personal bookshelf. You can even download an ebook or audiobook directly into Thorium Reader for instant reading.\nSo, how do you find an OPDS catalog? It's simple. Look for a hyperlink (URL) leading to the catalog. Copy this URL into the Link field above. Keep in mind that there's no one-stop shop for all active OPDS catalogs. You'll need to contact your preferred library or bookseller and ask for their OPDS catalog URL. If you're not sure where to start, Wikipedia has a few registries of OPDS catalogs in various languages that might be helpful.\nThe Name field is left at your convenience; it provides an easy way to identify the feed in Thorium Reader.",
