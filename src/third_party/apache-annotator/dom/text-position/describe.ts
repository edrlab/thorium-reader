/**
 * Returns a {@link TextPositionSelector} that points at the target text within
 * the given scope.
 *
 * When no scope is given, the position is described relative to the document
 * as a whole. Note this means all the characters in all Text nodes are counted
 * to determine the target’s position, including those in the `<head>` and
 * whitespace, hence even a minor modification could make the selector point to
 * a different text than its original target.
 *
 * @example
 * ```
 * const target = window.getSelection().getRangeAt(0);
 * const selector = await describeTextPosition(target);
 * console.log(selector);
 * // {
 * //   type: 'TextPositionSelector',
 * //   start: 702,
 * //   end: 736
 * // }

 * finding occurrences and determining prefix and suffix. Defaults to the full
 * Document that contains `range`.
 * @returns The selector describing `range` within `scope`.
