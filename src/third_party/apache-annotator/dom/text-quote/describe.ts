/**
 * Returns a {@link TextQuoteSelector} that unambiguously describes the given
 * range of text, within the given scope.
 *
 * The selector will contain the *exact* target quote, and in case this quote
 * appears multiple times in the text, sufficient context around the quote will
 * be included in the selector’s *prefix* and *suffix* attributes to
 * disambiguate. By default, more prefix and suffix are included than strictly
 * required; both in order to be robust against slight modifications, and in an
 * attempt to not end halfway a word (mainly for the sake of human readability).
 *
 * @example
 * ```
 * const target = window.getSelection().getRangeAt(0);
 * const selector = await describeTextQuote(target);
 * console.log(selector);
 * // {
 * //   type: 'TextQuoteSelector',
 * //   exact: 'ipsum',
 * //   prefix: 'Lorem ',
 * //   suffix: ' dolor'
 * // }
 * ```
 *
 * @param range - The {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Range
 * | Range} whose text content will be described
 * @param scope - A Node or Range that serves as the ‘document’ for purposes of
 * finding occurrences and determining prefix and suffix. Defaults to the full
 * Document that contains `range`.
 * @param options - Options to fine-tune the function’s behaviour.
 * @returns The selector unambiguously describing `range` within `scope`.
