/**
 * Find the elements corresponding to the given {@link
 * CssSelector}.
 *
 * The given CssSelector returns all elements within `scope` that it matches.
 *
 * The function is curried, taking first the selector and then the scope.
 *
 * As there may be multiple matches for a given selector, the matcher will
 * return an (async) iterable that produces each match in the order they are
 * found in the document.
 *
 * Note that the Web Annotation specification does not mention whether an
 * ‘ambiguous’ CssSelector should indeed match all elements that match the
 * selector value, or perhaps only the first. This implementation returns all
 * matches to give users the freedom to follow either interpretation. This is
 * also in line with more clearly defined behaviour of the TextQuoteSelector:
 *
 * > “If […] the user agent discovers multiple matching text sequences, then the
 * > selection SHOULD be treated as matching all of the matches.”
 *
 * Note that if `scope` is *not* a Document, the [Web Annotation Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/REC-annotation-model-20170223/#css-selector)
 * leaves the behaviour undefined. This implementation will, in such a case,
 * evaluate the selector relative to the document containing the scope, but only
 * return those matches that are fully enclosed within the scope. There might be
 * edge cases where this is not a perfect inverse of {@link describeCss}.
 *
 * @example
 * ```
 * const matches = createCssSelectorMatcher({
 *   type: 'CssSelector',
 *   value: '#target',
 * });
 * for await (const match of matches) {
 *   console.log(match);
 * }
 * // <div id="target" …>
 * ```
 *
 * @param selector - The {@link CssSelector} to be anchored.
 * @returns A {@link Matcher} function that applies `selector` to a given
 * `scope`.
 *
 * @public
