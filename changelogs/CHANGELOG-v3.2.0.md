# Thorium Reader v3.2.0

## Summary

Version `3.2.0` was PRE-released on **01 August 2025**.

(SEE [v3.2.1 changelog](./CHANGELOG-v3.2.1.md))

**NOTE:** version `3.2.0` was published as a pre-release with only Linux and Windows installers (MacOS was missing at that point). This pre-release was removed when a fixed-layout zoom bug was discovered. This bug is now fixed and will be published in patched version `3.2.1`. Apologies for the inconvenience, especially to the few Linux or Windows users who downloaded Thorium version `3.2.0`. You will get the notification when `3.2.1` is available.
